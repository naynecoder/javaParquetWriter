# javaParquetWriter
Write parquet files with java keeping dependencies at the bare minimum.

It can be done with a few lines with Spark or pyArrow, but it serves
as an example of how to write Parquet files with plain Java. It wouldn't
be that hard to turn into generics and write any kind of csv file.
